It is what it sounds like. I attempt to implement the algorithms described
in the book "Computer Graphics from Scratch" in scheme. To be more specific a
dialect known as GNU Guile.

## Goals

- [ ] Relearn some computer graphics knowledge
- [ ] Make use of the GNU Guile Manual
- [ ] Learn how to dab
- [ ] Use Scheme for somewhat of a real project

## Resources
