# Computer Graphics From Scratch in Scheme

It is what it sounds like. I attempt to implement the algorithms described
in the book "Computer Graphics from Scratch" in scheme. To be more specific a
dialect known as GNU Guile.

## Goals

- [ ] Get good a scheme
- [ ] Relearn some computer graphics knowledge
- [x] Make use of the GNU Guile Manual
- [x] Learn how to dab
- [ ] Use Scheme for somewhat of a real project
- [ ] implement the ray tracer
- [ ] implement to Rasterizer

## Resources

- GNU Guile Manual
- Stack Overflow
- Scheme Language Reference
